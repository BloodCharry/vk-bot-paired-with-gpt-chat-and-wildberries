Bot in the social network VKontakte, which communicates with users via chat GPT, using OpenAI API. In addition, the bot automatically parses the online store Wildberries and uploads the cheapest products in certain categories to the VKontakte group once an hour.

To implement this project we used the Python programming language and libraries for working with the VKontakte API OpenAI API, as well as for parsing web pages, such as selenium, requests and BeautifulSoup.

First I created a bot in a VKontakte group and configured it to work with the VKontakte API. Then I configured the bot to use the OpenAI API to process user messages and generate responses based on machine learning.

Next I set up automatic parsing of the online store Wildberries using selenium, requests and BeautifulSoup. When parsing, the bot selects certain categories of products and uploads information about the cheapest products to the VKontakte group. It uses the VKontakte API methods to upload text and graphic data to the group.

Thus, the bot created is capable of processing users' messages and responding to them with machine learning, as well as automatically parsing the Wildberries online store and uploading information about cheap products to the VKontakte group. This bot can be useful for promoting products in the online store and increasing the number of subscribers in the VKontakte group.

I do not keep the code in the public domain because it is my livelihood, sorry).
